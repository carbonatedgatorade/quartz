## What songs are you best known for? 
_Harper’s Devotion_. A sad, short tale about a musician that falls in love with a moon. Start with a **Celestial Lute**. Reveals the constellations above, no matter the weather.
## What pays your way across the land?
**Performance.** Performing at taverns always yields both room and board. Sometimes you even get tips! Start with an extra **10gp**.
## Bond
You inherited an old **Journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly written from the journal’s perspective. The writing is crude but accurate.
