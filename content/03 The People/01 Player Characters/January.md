## What got the better of you?
An antlered, toothy demon that nearly ended you. Take a blood-stained **Bone Knife** (d6). On **Critical Damage**, its next attack becomes _enhanced_ from contact with blood.

## What tool saved your life? 
**Greenwhistle**. A small flute that calms plants, making passage through areas heavy with plant life a bit easier.

## Bond
A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20Gp** and a **Strange Compass** (_petty_) that always points towards something deep in the Wood.
