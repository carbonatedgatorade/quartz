## How did you earn your bow?
**Scouting**. When taking the Travel action, your presence decreases the chance of getting lost by one step (e.g. 4-in-6 becomes 3-in-6).
## What kind of wood is your bow made from?
**Striped Bamboo** (d6). Collapsible, it only requires one slot (but still requires both hands).
## Bond
During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **Letter** (_petty_), sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord Of Winter**.
