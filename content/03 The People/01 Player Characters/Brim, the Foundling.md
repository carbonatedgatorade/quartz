## Who took you in?
A troupe of traveling entertainers. For a time, they were like family to you. One day you woke up and they were gone with no explanation. Take a **Storybook**, a **Dagger** (d6), and some burning questions.

## What keeps away bad things?
A smooth blue stone that helps recall dreams more clearly. Overuse can cause dream-addiction.

## What is your bond?
A white crow appeared to you in a dream, holding a twig in its mouth. You awoke the next morning with the **Twig** (_prettyyyyy_) in your hand. You believe it brings you luck. It smells faintly of sulfur.

## Omen
Hunters talk of a curse that befalls any who kill a beast with a streak of white fur: soon after, they are found dead in their homes. Each day, there are fewer and fewer creatures to hunt.
