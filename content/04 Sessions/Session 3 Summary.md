## Summary
The party returned home to Coratón and spent a week or so resting. (In this session we covered downtime mechanics!)

## Notable Moments
- Brim, resolving to carry her weight after last time, trains in combat with January at the local fighters guild. (Step 1 of a 3-step clock.)
- Lu hangs out with Lisak, bringing xem some flowers that they picked nearby. The two have a good rapport, and Lisak promises to come see Lu play at the House of Blue Lights.
- January spends time building trust with Luka, Vale's horse. It seems to go well! Later January goes to Brim for a dream reading, and leaves with a sinking feeling in the pit of their stomach.
- Cheò runs into Cas, her apprentice Moss, and her goat Marble, up on the plateau while gathering herbs. He gets a weird feeling from Moss, but establishes a friendly relationship with Cas during their conversation. It seems like she may offer work down the line, if their priorities intersect.
