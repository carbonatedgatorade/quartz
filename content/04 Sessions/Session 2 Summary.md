## Summary
On their way back home to [[01 The World/Hubs/Coratón|Coratón]] the party stopped in a riverside town of modest stature called Verend. Here they were able to sell off their valuables, resupply, and rest. Before they could leave they were approached by the town's witch, an old orc named [[03 The People/02 Everyone Else/Emil|Emil]]

They tasked the party with traveling to the Dawnwood, a nearby forest, where a wyvern had taken roost. Normally wyverns are isolate creatures, and stay far away from settlements, but this one had been exhibiting odd behavior, and was posing a threat to locals. Emil believed the creature to be wounded or otherwise afflicted, and so sought a peaceful resolution.
## Notable Moments
- Lu met some water elementals, and got a cool magic rock from them.
- Everyone talked with Greg who is nice and not a problem at all.
- January sensed a demon stalking the wood.
- The party encountered the Quarells trapped within the Sister Stones. Veda and January traversed the stones in order to free them. Later, Cheò bested them in an archery competition.
- Brim was nearly flattened by a falling tree, but January pushed her out of the way.
## Resolution
- The wyvern was subdued successfully and the salve that Emil provided was applied, easing the pain the creature had been in.
- The gnarled oak tree, which the demon inhabited, was burned by the party, releasing its hold on the wood.
