## Summary
At the behest of the [[followers of the Pale Moon]] the party descended into the crypt of Ser Hæthia to lift the curse placed on it back in the Long Ago. In the process they discovered the truth behind the myth: that the story of betrayal was false, that the [[Frost Shepherds]] fought to prolong the winter, that their death curse was what afflicted the land, and what separated knight and lady for centuries upon centuries. 

Through their exploring the party learned the names of Hæthia's hounds and used them to open the final chamber of the crypt; after conversing with the ghost of the knight, they agreed to take the *Moonstone Ring* to the Lady in her tower, uniting them after so long apart. 

## Notable Moments
- Cheò threw his torch. But thankfully he found it again! He also did language extremely well.
- In a moment of impulse, Brim stole the cloth that covered the eyes of the statue in the crypt. 
- Veda cracked open a lockbox and managed to dodge the poison needle trap that lay within. 
- January found a very cool sword. 
- Lu gazed upon the stars of a world not their own. 

## Resolution
- The reunited couple kissed (with tongue). 
- The Lady of Winter rewarded the party with silver cords and ice jewels, and invited them to stay for a few days to join in the festivities.
- In a few weeks the link between worlds will dissipate, resolving the issue for the followers of the Pale Moon.
